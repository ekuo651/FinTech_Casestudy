## Overview and Origin
* Name of company: 

Reonomy

* When was the company incorporated? 

March 1, 2013

* Who are the founders of the company? 

Reonomy was founded by Charlie Oshman and Richard Sarkis in 2013. The idea came from Oshman, who worked at 

 The company is currently on its series C-II funding round. 


## Business Activities

Reonomy was created to provide users with a reliable and centralized source of commercial real estate data. 

The original intended user was real estate analysts who needed to conduct research on development sites or potential rental sites.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Reonomy's platform is unique in that there has never been a centralized source of information on this scale in commercial real estate before. 

They offer a unique service called TrueOwner. This service uses their platform to identify the owners of LLC's. 


**Technology**

Reonomy primarily uses machine learning to amass data from disparate public and private sources and integrate it into its own data platform. The data is restructured using its own univeral language, Reonomy ID. Reonomy ID allows for users to reconcile redundant or inconsistent data (i.e. inconsistent spelling or notation for street names) by giving each property a unique Reonomy ID. Reonomy ID is modeled after CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures), which is used for identifiying securities.

Reonomy also uses AI and predictive analytics to determine which properties are more likely to sell and their expected sale date. This type of information is very useful even on the residental side, when trying to determine what renovations or repairs to prioritize.

Having been on the market for 6 years, Reonomy's algorithms have evaluated billions of data points. The algorithms are used to spot abnormal data points, and flag it for further verification.

Reonomy also uses proprietary machine learning algorithms on the private data sources provided by data partners to identify owners behind LLC's.




## Landscape

Reonomy is a Real Estate fintech company. They provide a platform that centralizes real estate information to facilitate more efficient real estate research. 


Real estate reseach has come a long way in the last decade with the advent of websites like Redfin, Trulia, Streeteasy and Zillow, all companies who provide property records on their websites. However,all the above companies have a focus in residential real estate and not commercial. Trulia, StreetEasy and Zillow also focuses more on rentals while Redfin has more of a focus on buy and selling properties. 

## Results
**Impact**

While the platform was originally meant for large commercial real estate corporations to streamline their research and due dilligence process. When the platform was conceived of, many thought that it would replace a large part of a broker's job, since the data provided could 

**Performance**

As a data company providing a platform to users, Reonomy's performance could be assessed by looking at its data aggregation/acquistion and by its subsciber base. In the last two years, Reonomy has been steadily amassing data partners and private data sources. In 2018, they negotiated partnerships with Avison Young, Cushman Wakefield, Newmark Knight Frank and WeWork.  

Reonomy kicked off its most recent round of data partnerships starting May 2019 with Dun & Bradstreet (formerly NYSE: DNB), a real estate brokerage and data analytics firm. Reonomy will become its exclusing data redistribution partner for North American real estate data. A deal with CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX), a leading provider of consumer, financial and property data, soon followed. Reonomy will be CoreLogic's preferred commercial real estate data partner.

Lastly, in July, Reonomy finalized a deal with Black Knight, NYSE: BKI, a real estate and data analytics firm, to incorporate their data into the Reonomy platform. Black Knight maintains an extensive, nationwide commercial property data set which itself is cultivated from both public and private data sources. 
Sarkis, Reonomy CEO, expects these additions to significantly improve the reliability of Reonomy's existing data. 

As a subscription sellilng company, Reonomy is also making significant headway. February 2019, Reonomy signed their largest client yet, [CBRE](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CBRE:US), one of the largest commercial real estate services company in the world ($17.58B market cap). Currently, they have contracts with 9 of the 10 leading commercial real estate firms. 

Additionally, Reonomy offers a truly unique product called "TrueOwner." TrueOwner is advertised to "pierce the LLC veil" and allow users to find the owners of LLC's. This information is not available via public records and is very difficult to find even with extensive research. Reonomy is able to offer this service by leveraging the large datasets of its private data partners. 

The TrueOwner product has allowed Reonomy to expand its targeted subscriber base far beyond traditional real estate professionals like lenders, banks, mortgage brokers and general brokers. Roofing companies, utility providers, energy companies and solar power installation companies have all found success using Reonomy to grow their business. 

Accountants performing cost segregation studies have also been able to more efficiently identify potential clients. Cost segregation studies take advantage of the fact that certain assets have bonus depreciation or have a shorter depreciation schedule based on different types of usage. The study is done to reduce current tax obligations through reclassifying qualifying assets. The study is usually quite expensive, but can be very beneficial for very large scale construction projects. (As context, the potential tax benefits of my current company's $5M renovation project was not enough to justify a cost segreration study.) Using TrueOwner, accountants are able to more accurately determine the size of a company or individual's portfolio and better evaluate those who could benefit from a cost segregation study. 

**Competitors**

The CoStar Group, NYSE:CSGP, is currently the largest CRE data analytics platform provider. Their products cover a wide variety of CRE related information including commercial listings, leasing data, comps, commercial landlord & tenant data, risk management management software and investment advising software. They have been active since the 90's and had their IPO in 1998. 

The CoStar suite is the industry standard, but there are several key issues. First, the platform is cost prohibitive, starting around ~$1,000/month. It is also difficult to ascertain its true price since it is not listed on their website. The Reonomy platform's most inexpensive subscription starts at $50/month, with a mid-level option of $250/month and a top-tier option for $399/month (top tier pricing not listed on their website). 

Second, the data offered on the CoStar platforms can sometimes be unreliable. So far, there has been no algorthmic verification process. CoStar still relies heavily on listings, most of which still require a CoStar representative to onboard. Reonomy uses its data partnerships to verify redundant data as well as algorthms to spot and verify abnormalities.

Third, CoStar does not update in real time and, as previously mentioned, collectes data through manual means. Reonomy regularly scrapes data from its large network of public and private sources to update and verify in real time. 

CoStar's suite covers a wider variety of topics than Reonomy, however, they seem to be separate modules and relies on older technology. The input data for all of their modules likely need manual input. It also doesn't look like the modules are linked.

Real Capital Analytics, a CRE data analytics firm who focuses on transactional data (and also uses Dun & Bradstreet, CoreLogic and Black Knight), just closed a $115 million dollar investment with Susquehanna Realty in late June. However, the company does not seem to offer a user platform for their data. 

Credifi is another CRE data analytics startup that has gained traction, however they recently laid off a quarter of their staff after failing to garner interest from the financial sector. 

Overall, no other company offers a CRE data platform that is as centralized, reliable and updated as Reonomy. Also, no other company offers a product that is even comparable to TrueOwner.



## Recommendations
CRE as a data class

Expand into residential real estate

Acquire PeerStreet or other real estate crowdfunding
