## Overview and Origin

Reonomy is a New York City based commercial real estate data platform startup founded on March 1, 2013 and incorporated as Scryer, Inc. Charlie Oshman came up with the idea after hearing a friend who worked in commercial real estate describe how he conducted research. Oshman was surprised by how inefficient and manual the process was, and that there was no centralized database for an industry worth trillions of dollars. Coming from a software engineering background, Oshman thought that this was a market ripe for disruption, but he realized that he would need help on the financing side. 

He was introduced to Richard Sarkis later that year. Sarkis was a VP at McKinsey at the time and wanted to find his way back to his entrepreneurial roots. Sarkis remarked that he had thought their first meeting in a downtown Le Quotidien would be a quick, half hour conversation. Instead, he and Oshman spoke for hours and he phoned home telling his wife that their lives would be changed forever. Soon after, they hired Guillermo Sanchez, Reonomy’s first employee, as Director of Engineering and Harlan Milkove as VP of Engineering. Together, the four are the founders of Reonomy.

Sarkis currently serves as the company's CEO. The other three founders have since left the company; Milkove left in 2014, Sanchez left in 2016 and Oshman left his position in 2016 but still serves on the Board of Directors. 

Reonomy obtained $1.5 million in seed funding on March 1, 2013 from FinTech Collective, KEC Ventures, Tom Falus, Jeff Parker, Primary Venture Partners and Resolute Ventures. Their series A round of funding successfully raised $3.7 million on March 10, 2014. This round was anchored by Bain Capital and included several of the original investors. During this period, Reonomy was working on its proof of concept. They used the New York City real estate landscape to build a working platform, providing it for free to end users to gather feedback.

Their series B round raised $13 million on January 2, 2015, and was also lead by Bain Capital Group with some repeat investors and some new investors. With this round of funding, Reonomy focused on expanding the coverage of the platform to the rest of the United States. However, they quickly realized that with their current structure, they would have to build each region from the ground up. Reonomy decided to restructure their platform and build a univeral language called "Reonomy ID." Three months later, Reonomy decided to obtain a loan from Silicon Valley Bank for $4 million in lieu of another funding round. 

The most recent round of funding is split into series C and series C-II, which collectively raised $46 million. With this, Reonomy is now considered one of the most well funded real estate fintech startups. The company leading this funding round was Sapphire Ventures. Reonomy's goals for this period are improving the user interface of its platform (and would like to use Sapphire Ventures' past experience on this front), expanding to foreign nations and increasing its subscriber base. Reonomy also plans to expand its workforce from 45 to 90 in 2019 to accomplish its goals. 

## Business Activities

Reonomy was intended for use by commercial real estate firms to cut down on the inefficiencies in conducting research. It provides users with a reliable and centralized source of commercial real estate data and neighborhood data. 

At the time, and even now, reliable real estate data is notoriously difficult to gather. Many counties have digitized their property data, but most of them have different database structures. Also, it can be very challenging to even find a county's property data website. 

Websites and platforms containing large amounts of real estate data do exist, but a lot of them rely on manual entry and the data can often times be unreliable. Also, when all else fails, one must physically visit their local county office to find a file. And that is just for finding the location and physical attributes for one property. Previously, to get an understanding of a neighborhood, one had to physically visit the area and assess the neighborhood. 

Reonomy seeks cut down on the time spent researching and verifying property data by using both public and private sources to supplement its data platform. Additionally, they use machine learning to spot inconsistencies or abnormalities in data to flag for review. They have also sought to reduce the legwork involved in understanding the characteristics of a neighborhood by quantifying a properties proximity to desirable features like grocery stores, public transportation, coffee shops, etc.

**Technology**

Reonomy primarily uses machine learning to amass data from disparate public and private sources and integrate it into its own data platform. The data is restructured using its own univeral language, Reonomy ID. Reonomy ID allows for users to reconcile redundant or inconsistent data (i.e. inconsistent spelling or notation for street names) by giving each property a unique Reonomy ID. Reonomy ID is modeled after CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures), which is used for identifiying securities.

Reonomy also uses AI and predictive analytics to determine which properties are more likely to sell and their expected sale date. This type of information is very useful even on the residental side, when trying to determine what renovations or repairs to prioritize.

Having been on the market for 6 years, Reonomy's algorithms have evaluated billions of data points. The algorithms are used to spot abnormal data points, and flag it for further verification.

Reonomy also uses proprietary machine learning algorithms on the private data sources provided by data partners to identify owners behind LLC's for their TrueOwner product.


## Landscape

Reonomy is in the real estate domain. It provides a centralized source of commercial real estate data in a user friendly platform. Several platforms like this have been developed in the last decade like Redfin, Trulia, Streeteasy and Zillow. However, all of these companies focus on providing residential real estate, not commercial. Trulia, StreetEasy and Zillow also focuses more on apartment rentals while Redfin has more of a focus on buy and selling properties. CoStar Suite also has a platform aimed to serve the commercial real estate domain, but there are many issues with it. 

## Results
**Impact**

While the platform was originally meant for large commercial real estate corporations to streamline their research and due dilligence process. When the platform was conceived of, many thought that it would replace a large part of a broker's job, since the data it provides makes a large part of the broker's job redundant. However, many brokers have found ways to leverage the Reonomy platform to increase their sales through more targeted leads. 

Also, the TrueOwner product has allowed Reonomy to expand its targeted subscriber base far beyond traditional real estate professionals like lenders, banks, mortgage brokers and general brokers. Roofing companies, utility providers, energy companies and solar power installation companies have all found success using Reonomy to grow their business. 

Accountants performing cost segregation studies have also been able to more efficiently identify potential clients. Cost segregation studies take advantage of the fact that certain assets have bonus depreciation or have a shorter depreciation schedule based on different types of usage. The study is done to reduce current tax obligations through reclassifying qualifying assets. The study is usually quite expensive, but can be very beneficial for very large scale construction projects. (As context, the potential tax benefits of my current company's $5M renovation project was not enough to justify a cost segreration study.) Using TrueOwner, accountants are able to more accurately determine the size of a company or individual's portfolio and better evaluate those who could benefit from a cost segregation study. 

**Performance**

As a data company providing a platform to users, Reonomy's performance could be assessed by looking at its data aggregation/acquistion and by its subsciber base. In the last two years, Reonomy has been steadily amassing data partners and private data sources. In 2018, they negotiated partnerships with Avison Young, Cushman Wakefield, Newmark Knight Frank and WeWork.  

Reonomy kicked off its most recent round of data partnerships starting May 2019 with Dun & Bradstreet (formerly NYSE: DNB), a real estate brokerage and data analytics firm. Reonomy will become its exclusing data redistribution partner for North American real estate data. A deal with CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX), a leading provider of consumer, financial and property data, soon followed. Reonomy will be CoreLogic's preferred commercial real estate data partner.

Lastly, in July, Reonomy finalized a deal with Black Knight, NYSE: BKI, a real estate and data analytics firm, to incorporate their data into the Reonomy platform. Black Knight maintains an extensive, nationwide commercial property data set which itself is cultivated from both public and private data sources. 
Sarkis, Reonomy CEO, expects these additions to significantly improve the reliability of Reonomy's existing data. 

As a subscription sellilng company, Reonomy is also making significant headway. February 2019, Reonomy signed their largest client yet, [CBRE](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CBRE:US), one of the largest commercial real estate services company in the world ($17.58B market cap). Currently, they have contracts with 9 of the 10 leading commercial real estate firms. 

**Competitors**

The CoStar Group, NYSE:CSGP, is currently the largest CRE data analytics platform provider. Their products cover a wide variety of CRE related information including commercial listings, leasing data, comps, commercial landlord & tenant data, risk management management software and investment advising software. They have been active since the 90's and had their IPO in 1998. 

The CoStar suite is the industry standard, but there are several key issues. First, the platform is cost prohibitive, starting around ~$1,000/month. It is also difficult to ascertain its true price since it is not listed on their website. The Reonomy platform's most inexpensive subscription starts at $50/month, with a mid-level option of $250/month and a top-tier option for $399/month (top tier pricing not listed on their website). 

Second, the data offered on the CoStar platforms can sometimes be unreliable. So far, there has been no algorthmic verification process. CoStar still relies heavily on listings, most of which still require a CoStar representative to onboard. Reonomy uses its data partnerships to verify redundant data as well as algorthms to spot and verify abnormalities.

Third, CoStar does not update in real time and, as previously mentioned, collectes data through manual means. Reonomy regularly scrapes data from its large network of public and private sources to update and verify in real time. 

CoStar's suite covers a wider variety of topics than Reonomy, however, they seem to be separate modules and relies on older technology. The input data for all of their modules likely need manual input. It also doesn't look like the modules are linked.

Real Capital Analytics, a CRE data analytics firm who focuses on transactional data (and also uses Dun & Bradstreet, CoreLogic and Black Knight), just closed a $115 million dollar investment with Susquehanna Realty in late June. However, the company does not seem to offer a user platform for their data. 

Credifi is another CRE data analytics startup that has gained traction, however they recently laid off a quarter of their staff after failing to garner interest from the financial sector. 

Overall, no other company offers a CRE data platform that is as centralized, reliable and updated as Reonomy. Additionally, Reonomy product "TrueOwner" is truly unique. It is advertised to "pierce the LLC veil" and allow users to find the owners of LLC's. This information is not available via public records and is very difficult to find even with extensive research. This information is extremely valuable, and no other competitor has anything close. 


## Recommendations
Currently, Reonomy is focused on commercial real estate. Though, with Reonomy ID, there is no reason why they should not be able to expand into residential real estate. Their existing platform seems to be better built, and rely on more advanced technology than the competition (Redfin, Zillow & CoStar). Once they achieve more market penetration and increase their subscriber base, they can offer a free or cheaper version of their software to those only looking to purchase or rent for personal use. They can then collect the search history data and connect professional users/brokers to those clients.

Also, Reonomy could potentially take advantage of the emerging regulation technology (“regtech”) to integrate laws and policies into its platforms. High value markets like New York City, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have legislation that is trending towards increasing regulation. New York City just passed a landmark rent regulation bill that has already impacted the value of rent regulated properties. There are also whispers of a vacancy tax on commercial storefronts. All of these factors can heavily influence the value of property and the volatility of the market and should be properly accounted for in valuations. 

Additionally, one of the goals of Reonomy was to transform commercial real estate into a more popular asset class for investment, by making the data surrounding it more accessible and reliable. To fully take advantage of this, Reonomy should consider acquiring a commercial real estate crowdfunding company like PeerStreet.
